## Running the Pipeline

```bash
python pipeline.py
```

The first step of the pipeline is to enter a filename that contains the vulnerable code that you would like to be fixed.

```txt
The file that contains vulnerable code:
```

The next user input is contextual code.

```txt
Do you have any contextual code (y/n)
```

If you enter `y` you will then be prompted to enter the contextual code.

```txt
The code in plaintext:
```

The last thing you have to input is the consequences of insecure code.

```txt
What are the consequences if the code is not secure?
```
